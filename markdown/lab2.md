# Lab 2: Responsive Web Design

## 1. RWD

Responsive web design (RWD) is one of the trendiest technology buzz words in web
development. The terms was originally introduced in Ethan Marcotte’s A List Apart article in
2010. http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design.
1. Read the article carefully
2. Review also all the examples in the article. Review the code and see how the
responsiveness develops between different versions.

Answer to following questions:
- What is the purpose of the RWD? Why it is used? How things are done before RWD? What is the difference?
- How css media queries can help you building responsive web sites?
- Why to use em (font) based sizing for example margins?
- Article is already 7 years old, do we have any new technology which can be used to achieve same type of 
UI responsiveness as described in the article. Buzz words: (CSS Grid, Flexbox)

## 2. RWD Examples:

See few RWD examples. Test how different screen sizes works in desktop browser. Test
also sites on mobiles.

- https://www.bostonglobe.com/ (Ethan Marcotte works here)
- This site lists good examples of sites which uses media queries, test few from here: http://mediaqueri.es/

Take screenshots of the sites on different devices and screen sizes.

## 3. RWD in practice

Create a simple responsive web page where nothing is defined as pixels. Use CSS-reset
(http://cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/), and remember to follow coding conventions.
Styles must be stored in separate .css files.

Here are few screenshots you should follow:

If you have problems on mobile (in scaling), read this article:

After you have done the basic layout, how could you prevent user zooming the site on
mobile?

If you wish, you could also use Android SDK emulator to see the rendering in mobile.

## 4. Adding stuff

1. Create a copy of previous task.
2. Add a menu to it. Menu should be on the left side of the screen on wide screen, but
on the top on mobile portrait screen.
3. HTML5 specification introduces new semantic elements. One of them is a <figure>
element. Can you say why you should use it in addition to standard <img> elements?
4. Add few figure elements to previous assignment. Images should scale keeping their
aspect ratio based on the width of the document. See examples:

## 5. Responsive person list
Create a copy of last week’s person list project. Make it responsive!
